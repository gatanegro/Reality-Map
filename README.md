# 3DCOM Energy Mapping App

**Author:** Martin Doina  
**Framework:** 3D Collatz Octave Model (3DCOM)  
**Date:** August 2025

## Overview

This application visualizes the recursive structure of energy scales in the 3D Collatz Octave Model (3DCOM). It computes recursion indices for various energy nodes, maps them to a 3D attractor geometry, and analyzes relationships between quantum, atomic, nuclear, and gravitational domains.  

It is intended for **researchers and enthusiasts** exploring discrete recursive physics, emergent constants, and the unification of fundamental forces.

## Features

- Add elements with specified energy values or use predefined physical entities:
  - Electron, Proton, Neutron, Muon, Pion, W Boson  
  - Earth, Sun
- Visualize the 3D recursive attractor structure using Matplotlib.
- Domain-based coloring and markers for:
  - EM, Atomic, Nuclear, Gravitational
- Analyze recursive relationships, including:
  - Distance to LZ Attractor
  - Pairwise Δn, Δlayer, spatial distance, and energy ratio
- Export/import data as CSV.
- Export plots as high-resolution PNG.
- Visualize convergence of the 3DCOM wave function to the LZ attractor.
